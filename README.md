# Ecommerce-SQL-Churn-Prediction

A full-stack SQL and machine learning project that simulates a real-world e-commerce data pipeline. From relational database design and advanced SQL analytics to customer churn prediction using Python, this project showcases end-to-end data-driven decision making.

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes synthetic e-commerce transactional data and uses SQL and Python to answer key business questions. It also builds a churn prediction model based on customer behavior and purchasing patterns.

---

## Database Schema

The database is modeled using standard relational principles and contains five normalized tables:

- **Customers**: Customer demographics and region
- **Products**: Product metadata including category and price
- **Orders**: High-level order details (status, date)
- **Order_Items**: Line-level purchase details (quantity, price_each)
- **Payments**: Payment amounts and methods

SQL table creation and data loading are defined in `sql/create_all.sql`.

## SQL Analysis Highlights

All analytical queries are found in `sql/analytical_queries.sql`. Key questions answered:

- 💰 **Total revenue by product category**
- 👑 **Top customers by total spend**
- 📈 **Monthly revenue trends**
- 🌍 **Average order value by customer region**
- 🔁 **Repeat customer detection**

These queries utilize complex `JOIN`s, `GROUP BY`, subqueries, and aggregations to surface business-critical insights.

## Customer Churn Prediction (ML)

Built using `RandomForestClassifier`, the churn model predicts customer dropout based on:

- `days_since_last_order`
- `total_orders`
- `total_spent`

### ML Workflow (`ml/churn_prediction.py`)
- Load SQL-exported features (`churn_features.csv`)
- Define churn: `days_since_last_order > 90`
- Split into train/test, train a model, evaluate with confusion matrix
- Predict churn probability and save results to `churn_predictions.csv`
- Visualize feature importances and churn risk

---

## Results Sample

**Confusion Matrix:**

Perfect model performance on test set  
Model achieved perfect performance on the test set, suggesting strong signal in the features — though this may also indicate potential overfitting due to data simplicity or class separation.

```
Predicted
     0   1
  ----------
0 | 36 | 0
1 |  0 | 51
```

**Top Features:**
- `days_since_last_order` = strongest signal
- `total_orders` = valuable customer indicator

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **SQL**: MySQL Workbench
- **Python**: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Development**: VS Code

## Future Improvements

- Deploy model as a Flask API or Streamlit dashboard
- Add clustering to segment users further
- Incorporate product return rates or promo codes
- Replace synthetic data with anonymized real-world set
